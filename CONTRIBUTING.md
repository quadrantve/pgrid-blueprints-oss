## Running Tests

```
# Make sure you install the dependencies first before running tests.
$ npm install

# Run tests for the CLI (it could take awhile).
$ npm run test
```

## Debugging
<!-- Optional Section -->

## Coverage

We try and make sure that each new feature or bug fix has tests to go along with them in order to keep code coverages consistent and increasing. We are actively striving for 100% code coverage!

```
# You can run the following command to find out coverage
$ npm run coverage
```

## Types of Contributions

> Before contributing something, double check the issue you're creating doesn't already exist in the repository but doing a quick search. Search of the [current issues](https://github.com/npm/{{project-name}}/issues).

### Contributing a Question?
<!-- Replace {{project-name}} with repository name -->

Huh? ðŸ¤” Got a situation you're not sure about?! Perfect! We've got some resources you can use:
<!--
  Add additional resources/docs
    - If no resources/docs remove sentence: "We've got some resources you can use"
-->

You can create a new question [here](https://github.com/npm/{{project-name}}/issues/new?template=question.md&title=%5BQUESTION%5D+%3Ctitle%3E)!

### Contributing a Bug Fix?
<!-- Replace {{project-name}} with repository name -->

We'd be happy to triage and help! Head over to the issues and [create a new one](https://github.com/npm/{{project-name}}/issues/new?template=bug.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%3Ctitle%3E)!


### Contributing a Feature?

Snazzy, we're always up for fancy new things! If the feature is fairly minor [create a new one](https://github.com/npm/{{project-name}}/issues/new?template=feature.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Ctitle%3E), and the team can triage it and prioritize it into our backlog. However, if the feature is a little more complex, then it's best to create an [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) in our [RFC repository](https://github.com/npm/rfcs). Exactly how to do that is outlined in that repository. If you're not sure _exactly_ how to implement your idea, or don't want to make a document about your idea, then please create an issue on that repository. We consider these RRFC's, or a "Requesting Request For Comment".

## Development Dependencies
<!-- Replace {{project-name}} with repository name -->
<!-- Add additional resources -->

You'll need a few things installed in order to update and test the {{project-name}} during development:

* [node](https://nodejs.org/) v10 or greater

> We recommend that you have a [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed if you plan on fixing bugs that might be present in a specific version of node. With a version manager you can easily switch versions of node and test if your changes to the CLI project are working.

* [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.11+
